# Markdown | άλφα (Alpha)

The all-in-one Markdown tool you didn't know you wanted:tm:

## Why?

Over the year I've built many little scripts to try to imperfectly solve little
annoyances I've had with my Markdown files. Instead of little ad-hoc and good
enough Python regex's I've decided to build the one tool to rule them all for
handling Markdown files.

## Goals

- Tree-sitter based parsing for _blazingly fast_ speed and accuracy
- Automatically rename links when renaming files
- The greatest syntax highlighting
  - Even for fenced code blocks
- Clean up common style gotchas
- Easily install with a package manager
- Change file naming conventions quickly to
  - snake_case
  - camelCase
  - Or any other common naming convention
- Convert between Markdown flavors
  - GitHub
  - CommonMark
  - Pandoc
  - And more
- Provide outstanding documentation
- All from the terminal!

# Big promises, what now?

This will be a large project, so it will probably take a while. For now you can
track the changes here in this repository as I get the tool into a usable state.
If you have any ideas or suggestions please open an issue. If you would like to
help. First, thank you so much! Second, please open a pull request with what you
would like to change.
